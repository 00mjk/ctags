# dist-test-cases --- Generate Makefile.am and fragments of autoconf ac file for Units and Tmain dir
#
# COPYRIGHT NOTICE SHOULD BE HERE

#
# Originally this file generates just one file with much "EXTRA_DISTS += " lines.
# However, now we have so many test related files, EXTRA_DISTS becomes too long
# to pass it to execve.
# See http://gnu-automake.7480.n7.nabble.com/argument-list-too-long-in-project-with-many-files-td21323.html
#
# This second version generates multiple Makefile.am files to make each EXTRA_DISTS in the Makefile.am
# short.
