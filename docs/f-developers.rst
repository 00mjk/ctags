Masatake YAMATO <yamato@redhat.com>

	I'm using ctags in batch jobs running on my source code base
	where most of all source code in Fedora are deployed.  I'm an
	Emacs user, so generally I don't use ctags interactively
	except when hacking fishman-ctags. Therefore my primary goal
	is to improve the robustness of parsers: I introduced Units
	test facility and badinput command for achieving the goal.
	The secondary goal is to support more languages and formats: I
	introduced optlib and xcmd. I'm working on Fedora. I don't
	have access to the other platforms.
