Who we are
============================================================

Please, add your name, background and interests here If you are
interested in contributing to fishman-ctags steadily. So we can
dispatch a task and/or an issue to the right person!

(Keep the list in alphabetical order.)


Frank Fesevur <ffes@users.sourceforge.net>

	My current use of ctags is for a Notepad++ plug-in I'm writing.
	The plug-in is not yet released because of problems with the
	Windows version of ctags. Those problems are fixed by now.
	I am a Windows developer, but also an occasional Ubuntu and
	Raspbian user at home. I wrote the windres parser.


Masatake YAMATO <yamato@redhat.com>

	I'm using ctags in batch jobs running on my source code base
	where most of all source code in Fedora are deployed.  I'm an
	Emacs user, so generally I don't use ctags interactively
	except when hacking fishman-ctags. Therefore my primary goal
	is to improve the robustness of parsers: I introduced Units
	test facility and badinput command for achieving the goal.
	The secondary goal is to support more languages and formats: I
	introduced optlib and xcmd. I'm working on Fedora. I don't
	have access to the other platforms.

Vitor Antunes <vitor.hda@gmail.com>

	I've been working with Verilog for most of the last 10
	years and am an avid Vim user. My goal is to improve the
	Verilog parser such that Vim can get the most out of it
	in plugins like Tagbar and to support the Omni
	completion plugin I am writing.
