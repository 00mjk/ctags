Running multiple parsers on an input file
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Universal-ctags provides parser developers ways(guest/host and
sub/base) to run multiple parsers for an input file.

This section shows concepts behind the running multiple parsers,
real examples, and APIs.

.. _host-guest-parsers:

Applying a parser to specified areas of input file (guest/host)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

guest/host combination considers the case that an input file has areas
written in languages different from the language for the input file.

*host parser* parses the input file and detects the areas.
*host parser* schedules *guest parsers* parsing the areas.
*guest parsers* parses the areas.

guest parsers are run only when `--extras=+g` is given.  If
`--fields=+E` is given, all tags generated by a guest parser is marked
`guest` in their `extras:` fields.

Examples of guest/host combinations
......................................................................

{CSS,JavaScript}/HTML parser combination
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For a html file, you may want to run HTML parser, of course. The
html file may have CSS areas and JavaScript areas. In other hand
Universal-ctags has both CSS and JavaScript parsers. Don't you
think it is useful if you can apply these parsers to the areas?

In this case, HTML has responsible to detect the CSS and
JavaScript areas and record the positions of the areas.
The HTML parser schedules delayed invocations of CSS and
JavaScript parsers on the area with promise API.

Here HTML parser is a host parser. CSS and JavaScript parsers
are guest parsers.

See :ref:`The new HTML parser <html>` and parsers/html.c.


C/Yacc parser combination
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A yacc file has some areas written in C. Universal-ctags has both YACC
and C parsers. You may want to run C parser for the areas from YACC
parser.

Here YACC parser is a host parser. C parser is a guest parser.
See :ref:`promise API <promiseAPI>` and parsers/yacc.c.


Pod/Perl parser combination
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pod (Plain Old Documentation) is a language for documentation.  The language
can be used not only in a stand alone file but also it can be
used inside a Perl script.

Universal-ctags has both parsers for Perl and Pod.
The Perl parser recognizes the area where Pod document is
embedded in a Perl script and schedules applying pod parser
as a guest parser on the area.


API for running a parser in an area
......................................................................

:ref:`promise API <promiseAPI>` can be used.
A host parser using the interface has responsibility to detect areas
from input stream and record them with name of guest parsers that will
be applied to the areas.
