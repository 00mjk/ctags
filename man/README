Rules for writing man pages
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* put two single quotes around an option name like ``--help``.

* put double quotes an example of command line, option usage like
  "--langdef=MyLang" and referring a section.

* .. code-block:: LANGUAGE.. cannot be handled well in rst2man.
  However, if LANGUAGE is not given, it works.

  See https://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/patches/141/

* use two asterisks for newly introduced conceptual **word** and reserved
  words. The reserved words are

  * "default" in --langmap

* use asterisks for option parameter like *LANG* in --kind-<LANG> option.
