About units test facility
============================================================

Background
------------------------------------------------------------
Exuberant ctags has a test facility. Main aim of the facility is
detecting regression. All files under Tests directory are given as
input for old and new version of ctags commands.  The output tags
files of both versions are compared.

The units test facility I describe here takes a different approach. An
input file and an expected output file are given by a contributor of a
language parser. The units test facility runs ctags command with the
input file and compares its output and the expected output file.

If a contributor sends a patch which may improve a language parser,
and if a reviewer is not familiar with that language, s/he cannot
evaluate it.

Unit test files, the pair of input file and expected output file may
be able to explain the intent of patch well; and may help the
reviewer.

How to write a test case
------------------------------------------------------------
The test facility recognizes an input file and an expected
output file by patterns of file name. They should be at
Units directory.

input-*.*

	Input file must have a prefix "input-". The
	rest of the name should explain the name of test case.


expected-*.*

	Expected output file must have a prefix "expected-".
	The rest of the name should be the same as associated
	input file.

args-*.*

	TBW

filter-*.*

	TBW

Example of files
------------------------------------------------------------

See input-c-sample.c and expected-c-sample.c under Units
directory.

How to run unit tests
------------------------------------------------------------

test.units target is added to testing.mak.


	 $ make -f testing.mak test.units

The result of unit tests is reported by lines.

During testing OUTPUT-*.*, EXPECTED-*.* and DIFF-*.* files are
generated. These are removed when the unit test is "Passed".

Example of running
------------------------------------------------------------

	$ make -f testing.mak test.units
	Testing cpp-type-alias-with-using-keyword.cpp...Passed
	Testing c-sample.c...Passed
